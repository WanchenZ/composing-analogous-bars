Given a rips-density bifiltration, we compute analogous bars between different density thresholds and check if the composition of analogous bars from P to Q and Q to T is consistent with the analogous bars from P to T, where P, Q, T are nested point clouds.
We also found analogous bars from P to T need not to be have a factorization through Q.
